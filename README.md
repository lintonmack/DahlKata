# DahlKata

# Intro
A .Net Core Class Library Project using .Net Core version 3.1
The purpose of the task was to complete the Dahl Kata

#Details of the Kata
To try and encourage more sales of 5 different Roald Dahl
books they sell, a bookshop has decided to offer
discounts of multiple-book purchases.
 
One copy of any of the five books costs 8 EUR.
 
If, however, you buy two different books, you get a 5%
discount on those two books.
 
If you buy 3 different books, you get a 10% discount.
 
If you buy 4 different books, you get a 20% discount.
 
If you go the whole hog, and buy all 5, you get a huge 25%
discount.
 
Note that if you buy, say, four books, of which 3 are
different titles, you get a 10% discount on the 3 that
form part of a set, but the fourth book still costs 8 EUR.
 
Your mission is to write a piece of code to calculate the
price of any conceivable shopping basket (containing only
Roald Dahl books), giving as big a discount as possible.
 
For example, how much does this basket of books cost?
 
2 copies of the first book
2 copies of the second book
2 copies of the third book
1 copy of the fourth book
1 copy of the fifth book
 
Answer £51.60


# Further works
Due to time constraints there are a number of tasks I would have liked to complete but couldn't, these include:
- Reassess the names of the classes and interfaces to make them more meaningful to their purposes.
- Writing further unit tests for the services that were created.
- Writing the final test to test the use case 

        "2 copies of the first book
        2 copies of the second book
        2 copies of the third book
        1 copy of the fourth book
        1 copy of the fifth book
